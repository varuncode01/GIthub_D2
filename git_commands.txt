I am creating this file to remember, test and learn git and github

'clone' - Cloning a repository(someone else's) on your local machine
git clone Repository Link
git clone https://github.com/varuncode01/GIthub_D.git

'git status' - tell's status and branch

'git add' - file name or if you want to add all your changes in all files use - 'git add .'

'git commit -m "some message it can also be the change you did"' - to finalise and update the file locally in our system
'git push origin main' - upload local repo content to remote repo(github)
* git push is main command 'origin' is we named the file from where we copied it from
* 'main' - it's main folder
