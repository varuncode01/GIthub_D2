I am creating this file to remember, test and learn git and github

'clone' - Cloning a repository(someone else's) on your local machine
git clone Repository Link
git clone https://github.com/varuncode01/GIthub_D.git

'git status' - tell's status and branch

'git add' - file name or if you want to add all your changes in all files use - 'git add .'

'git commit -m "some message it can also be the change you did"' - to finalise and update the file locally in our system
'git push origin main' - upload local repo content to remote repo(github)
* git push is main command 'origin' is we named the file from where we copied it from
* 'main' - it's main folder

'git init' - used to create new git repo
'git remote add origin link' it's link of repo you created you github
'git remote -v' - to verify remote
'git branch' - to check branch
'git branch -MO main' - to raname branch
'git push origin main'
'git push -u origin main' - so you don't have to write origin main again all files will be origin main automatically

'ls' - list files inside directory you are in
'ls -a' - all files will be shown including hidden files\

'cd' folder name or path - change directory
'cd..' - exist from this directory

* if you change something in file status will be 'modified'
* if you add a new file status will be 'untracked'
* for the cases you have to 'add'
* add - file status 'staged' and ready to 'commit'
* commit - status 'unmodified'/'unchanged'
